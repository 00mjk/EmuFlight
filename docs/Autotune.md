# Autotune

Autotune helps to automatically tune your multirotor.

## Configuration.

Autotune only works in HORIZON or ANGLE mode.

Configure a switch on your transmitter to activate the AUTOTUNE and HORIZON or ANGLE modes using the auxilary configuration.

## Using autotuning

Launch the multirotor.

Flip the autotune switch on your transmitter.

Observe roll/left/right a few times.

PID settings will have been updated for ROLL/YAW.

Disable the switch while still flying.

Enable the switch again.

Observe pitch forwards/backwards a few times.

PID settings will have been updated for PITCH/YAW.

Disable the switch again.

PIDS are tunes, fly and see if it's better.

Land.

Verify results via an app while power still applied if desired.

Cutting the power will loose the unsaved pids.

If you're happy with the pids then while disarmed flip the autotune switch again to save all settings.

A beeper will sound indicating the settings are saved.
